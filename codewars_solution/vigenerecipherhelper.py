"""
The Vigenère cipher is a classic cipher
originally developed by Italian cryptographer 
Giovan Battista Bellaso and published in 1553. 
It is named after a later French 
cryptographer Blaise de Vigenère, who had 
developed a stronger autokey cipher (a 
cipher that incorporates the message of 
the text into the key).

The cipher is easy to 
understand and implement, but survived three centuries 
of attempts to break it, earning it the nickname 
"le chiffre indéchiffrable" 
or "the indecipherable cipher."
